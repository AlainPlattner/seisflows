# SeisFlows consists of interacting 'system', 'preprocess', 'solver', 
# 'postprocess', 'optimize', and 'workflow' objects. The SeisflowObjects utility
# initializes these objects and makes them accessible through the standard 
# Python import system. The SeisflowsParameters and SeisflowsPaths utilities 
# read parameter files and store each file's contents in globally accessible
# dictionaries.

# Now SeisFlows is fully loaded. All that remains is to execute the workflow.
# Depending on the system specified in the parameter file, the workflow may be 
# executed immediately or passed to a scheduler.
